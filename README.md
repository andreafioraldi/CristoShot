This is the story of a bored high-school student in Latina, Italy.
During the "Art" class, we were used to go to the computer lab to make PowerPoint slides about something that we were studying.
What an easy way to teach!

Many of you can understand that making slides is boring, especially for a teenager.
I like art, but copy-pasting images from Google for hours was too much at some point.

So one day, I noticed that in the PC that I should have used to make the slides, a Windows XP machine, there was Visual C# 2008 installed.
When I was a teenager, I was able to code in C# as self-taught as I never studied programming before the university.

"Fuck you, teacher, I will not do any slide today in these 2 hours in the lab".

And so I started thinking about how to make some art, not just describe art that others made in the past. But how?

Rebellion ran in my blood, rebellion against the oppressive catholicism, against the common morality, against my teacher and the entire system.
So I decided to make something fun, but that will teach other people (my friends at school) that rebellion is an art.

Who is the most untouchable item or person in the common morality? Ofc, Jesus Christ.

I did the sum, and I made a game in which an ass (yes an ass) throws things from its sphincter at Christ (Cristo in Italian).
Christ is moving randomly, and when hit, he swears in Italian. Swear against the player or God, because every teenager hates a bit his father, or just say some funny stupid things.

In this repo, I publish the source code that I recently rediscovered in one of the hard disks there were lost in my parent's house. What a joy when I saw this folder, I hope you will enjoy the game, it will compile for sure with Visual Studio 2013 too as I updated the solution. I uploaded also a precompiled .NET (4 I guess) binary that I compiled years ago.
